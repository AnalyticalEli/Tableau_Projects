# Tableau_Projects
This a Catalogue of my Project in Tableau, where I created a visualization for theoretical employers interested in launching a lucrative Airbnb business in Seattle.

My job was structured in 4 stages:

Clean the data, Join it, Filter and Visualize it, and provide an oral presentation of why this information gives our company an advantage / why it's essential.
